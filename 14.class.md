1. dns service
# dns service is used to translate domain names to ip addreses
2. first create 11 instances with names frontend,mongodb,
   catalogue,redis,user,cart,mysql,shipping,rabbitmq,payment,dispatch



2. we are having single set of servers,if those consider as live servers where customer is using it,if developer want
   to test his new developed code he can not test it on live  servers it may impact customers.
   thats why they need seperate environments,like wise we need seperate environments.


3. create dns records for servers

4. connect to all servers through putty and execute code
5. change names to servers and clone roboshop-shell repo to server
6. execute frontend.sh using bash frontend.sh cammand

3. script is nothing but automating a manual work


## when we want code DRY we fuctions concept keep repeated code in one centralised place  and source it to required file
so thats why code will not repeat again and again
we can use it in multiple places
this called code dry
